# Static Site Generation (SSG) Deployment Guide

Your Next.js application has been successfully configured for static site generation. This means your entire website will be pre-rendered as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be deployed to any static hosting service.

## What was changed:

1. **next.config.js**: Added `output: 'export'` configuration
2. **Images**: Added `unoptimized: true` for static export compatibility
3. **API Routes**: Removed dynamic API routes (not compatible with static export)
4. **OG Images**: Converted from dynamic generation to static files
5. **Headers**: Removed custom headers (not supported in static export)

## Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `out/` directory containing all static files.

## Local testing:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will serve the static files locally for testing.

## Deployment options:

### 1. Netlify

- Connect your repository to Netlify
- Set build command: `npm run build`
- Set publish directory: `out`

### 2. Vercel

- Connect your repository to Vercel
- The platform will automatically detect Next.js static export

### 3. GitHub Pages

- Upload the contents of the `out/` directory to your gh-pages branch
- Or use GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### 4. Any static hosting service

- Upload the contents of the `out/` directory to:
  - AWS S3 + CloudFront
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Azure Static Web Apps
  - Firebase Hosting
  - Surge.sh
  - Any web server

## Important notes:

- **No server-side features**: API routes, server actions, and dynamic rendering are not available
- **Images**: All images are unoptimized for static export
- **OG Images**: You'll need to create actual image files for `public/og/og-id.png` and `public/og/og-en.png`
- **Trailing slashes**: URLs will have trailing slashes (configurable)
